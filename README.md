# All you need is Rails Engines

This Rails app contains the code for a modularised Rails application using Rails Engines and Packwerk.

This readme will be properly updated in the next few days but you can explore the code and I'm sure you'll learn a lot!

The way to better understand what goes on into creating an app like this is to follow every commit which has a complete and thorough explanation of what happened so you'll be able to replicate it step by step if you want.
